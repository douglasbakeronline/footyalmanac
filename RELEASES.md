# Releases

Newest first. Every release is an annotated git tag (`release-YYYY-MM-DD`,
with `-2`, `-3` for a second release the same day) and an entry here.

## Rolling back

The bot commits the daily archive to `main` between releases, so never
`git reset` past a release: that deletes graded predictions. Revert instead,
which leaves the bot's commits alone:

```
git log --oneline release-2026-09-27^..release-2026-09-27   # the release's commit(s)
git revert --no-edit <commit>                               # one commit
git push                                                    # deploy.yml rebuilds the site
```

A release with several commits: revert them newest first, or
`git revert --no-edit <first>^..<last>`. If a revert conflicts on a
bot-written file (`predictions/`, `record.json`, `current/`), keep the
current copy: `git checkout --ours <file>`.

## release-2026-09-27 — The Daily List

**What changed for a reader**

- The front page is now the **Daily List**: only the fixtures where the model
  gives one side 75% or more to win, never a draw, nothing flagged by
  Celtic's Law, and every club rated from a full prior season. The model's
  own read, no bookmaker input. Empty on days when nothing clears the bar.
  The full board is the Football tab, unchanged.
- The list is graded separately in `record.json` (`list`, `listDays`) from
  its first published day. Membership is archived with each prediction, so
  it is judged on what it said before kick-off.
- Slovenia no longer shows El Salvador's fixtures (see below).
- MLS, USL Championship, Chile, Uruguay and Peru now have a prior season, so
  their clubs are rated instead of dropped.

**Evidence behind the 75% bar** (details in `claude/daily-list.md`)

League walk-forward: 81.0% of 211 landed in 2025/26, 77.8% of 18 in 2026/27.
Internationals, 2026 holdout: 81.6% of 49. Above about 80% the hit rate
stops climbing. Form and last season's head-to-head were tested as extra
signals and add nothing measurable.

**Data fixes**

- `sources.ESPN_SLUGS`: `svn.1` pointed at `slv.1`, El Salvador. Salvadoran
  fixtures were published as Slovenian PrvaLiga from 10 Sep (never graded).
  52 competitions whose every slug returns 400 from ESPN removed; cup and
  international slugs corrected from ESPN's own league index.
- `sources.fetch_espn(clip=False)`: ESPN days are US Eastern, rows are UTC,
  so evening kick-offs in the Americas were clipped out. Backfill lost about
  half of each Americas season (MLS 2025: 259 of 541).
- `score.live_results` also queries the day before, so late kick-offs get
  graded.
- `sources.completeness(games=)` and `"games"` on `us.1`/`us.2`: MLS and USL
  are not round robins, and complete seasons read as 62% done.

**Files**

`build.py` (`LIST_MIN`, `LIST_BACKTEST`, `list_eligible`), `score.py`,
`index.html`, `sources.py`, `engine.py`, `backfill.py` (`--probe --on`),
`tune.py` (`lambdas(features=True)`, off by default), `nametest.py`
(Python 3.7 compatible, same checks), new `predictability.py` (advisory
only), new `history/` (5 seasons), `CLAUDE.md`, `claude/daily-list.md`.

**Not changed**

`engine.py` model constants, `calibration.json`, tier ladder, the full
board's ranking.

**Roll back**

`git revert --no-edit <release commit>`. The site returns to opening on the
Football board; `history/` files go with it and those leagues drop back to
unrated.
